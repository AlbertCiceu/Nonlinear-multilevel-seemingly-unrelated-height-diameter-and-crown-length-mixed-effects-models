# Nonlinear multilevel seemingly unrelated height-diameter and crown length mixed-effects models
This repository contains R scripts for fitting, calibrating, and cross-calibrating multilevel seemingly unrelated mixed-effects models. These models account for hierarchical data and shared structure. Associated publication: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fecs.2025.100322

We applied a multivariate modelling framework using nonlinear seemingly unrelated mixed-effects models (NSUR), based on a unique dataset of over 18,000 trees from five species in mixed and heterogeneous stands across central Romania. This approach replaces separate univariate models with a system that explicitly models residual and random-effect correlations between height and crown length equations.

By capturing these dependencies, the NSUR models improved calibration accuracy, particularly when both responses were used simultaneously, and yielded more coherent predictions. Our method also allowed for cross-model random-effect predictions, improving accuracy with limited field measurements. This framework offers an advanced alternative for constructing multi-response allometric models in complex stand conditions.
